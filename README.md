- Introduction

## Introduction
This project is a Sping application that allows you to filter the data of Ticketmaster site, and make statistics of the data.\
Ticketmaster is a well-known software dedicated to the management and booking of musical, theatrical, film and artistic events, available at https://www.ticketmaster.it/. \
Through the APIs derived from the TM Developer page, accessible through the Discovery API address, we get the metadata.\
The program will have to evaluate only the events located in USA and Europe.\
They are available through our application:
- filtering of events, foreseen in USA and / or Europe, through the selection of one or more States, followed by the production of statistics relating to the State or States chosen.
- filtering of events, foreseen in USA and / or Europe, through the selection of one or more genres, followed by the production of statistics relating to the chosen genre or genres.
## Application usage
After the application has been started, routes can be called from any browser or from an application such as postman.\
Example of usecase
>localhost:8080/<route_name> 

In this case 8080 is the standard port but can be changed.
